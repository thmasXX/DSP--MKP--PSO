Data files are marked 1-10 (do not change contents).
Different Python Files are available.
   - Simple PSO containing Single Mutation
   - PSO with Multiple RNG Selection
   - PSO with Adaptive Mutation Selection

**PLEASE MAKE SURE PYTHON FILES ARE IN SAME DIRECTORY AS TEXT FILES**

**PROGRAM REQUIRES copy, numpy, matplotlib, random, csv LIBRARIES**

**PROGRAM WAS BUILT ON PYTHON 3.9.4**

When starting program:
   - Input any choice of file (1-10).
   - Optimisation will start going through generation outputting best fitness.
   - Program will output best particle if optimum solution is found or max generations (set at 250) is met.
   - Choice of Y/N (case sens) to retry program with another data set is available afterwards.
   - If wishing to exit, enter "N".
